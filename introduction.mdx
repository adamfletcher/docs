## Why Starsheet?

### We don't hold your data to ransom

Starsheet publishes to an S3 bucket on an AWS account that you own, meaning you can cancel at any time and everything you've published will remain in place. We want customers to *want* to use Startsheet because it's a useful tool, not because they're locked in. Migrate to another solution at any time without a painful migration that requires updating applications that have already been distributed. 

### Simple, fair and accessible pricing

Our aim is to provide a slimmed down CMS, and by keeping it lean we can offer it at a fraction of the cost of other commercially available solutions, or building and operating a custom in-house tool. 

We don't punish your success by charging more as your team goes, or artificially cap plans based on bandwidth or unique users. Simply pay a fixed fee a month, plus AWS usage fees. 

### No infrastructure to maintain

Starsheet can set up resources for you automatically on your AWS account. Once created there's absolutely nothing to maintain. No servers that require monitoring, security patches to install, and you don't have to worry about scalability.
