## Data Types

### How types are determined

To avoid parsing issues in applications consuming the data, Starsheet will automatically infer the data type of a particular field based on all the values of that column. For example, if an entire column only contains numeric values (or null/empty values) the data will be output as a number, but if it contains a mix of numeric values and strings, all instances of that fields will be output of strings. 

The exception to this is when a sheet has been set to be output as key-value pairs, which causes the type of each instance to be evaluated independently. 

### Booleans

The following values are acceptable as booleans and will be converted to a boolean `true` or `false` in the output:
* A Ticked or Unticked Checkbox
* The string `Y` or `N`
* The string `1` or `0`
* The string `TRUE` or `FALSE`
* When combined  exclusively with the above "truthy" values, a null/empty value will be interpreted as false

### Arrays

Multiple columns can be combined into an array, by using the same column title suffixed with square brackets (`[]`). For example a sheet with the following structure:

| name   | tags[]     | tags[]     | tags[]     |
| ------ | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| item_a | category_a | category_b | category_c |
| item_b | category_b |            |            |

Would produce this output:

```json
{
  "worksheet_name": [
	{
		"name": "item_a",
		"tags": ["category_a", "category_b", "category_c"]
	},
	{
		"name": "item_a",
		"tags": ["category_b"]
	}
  ]
}
```


### Objects

To output fields as objects, add periods to the column title to indicate how they should be nested. For example a sheet with the following structure:

| name   | size.height | size.width |
| ------ | ----------- | ---------- |
| item_a | 200         | 100        |
| item_b | 400         | 150        |

Would produce this output:

```json
{
  "worksheet_name": [
	{
		"name": "item_a",
		"size": {
			"height": 200,
			"width": 100,
		}
	},
	{
		"name": "item_a",
		"size": {
			"height": 200,
			"width": 100,
		}
	}
  ]
}
```


## Excluding Data from Output

### Hiding Worksheets or Columns

To prevent a worksheet or column from being included in the output, prefix the column name or worksheet name with a `#` symbol. 

### Hiding Rows

To hide a row, create a column with the heading `!hide` and set it to a true value. A checked tickbox, `1`, `TRUE` or `Y` are all treated as true.  

Alternatively, to hide all rows by default, add a column with the heading `!show`. All rows that don't have a true value in this column will be hidden. 

## Modifying JSON Document Format

### Outputting a Worksheet as objects indexed by a key

By default, a worksheet is outputted in JSON as an array of objects. 


<Frame caption="Default Output">
```json
{
  "worksheet_name": [
	{
		"first_column_name": "a",
		"second_column_name": 1,
	},
	{
		"first_column_name": "b",
		"second_column_name": 2,
	}
  ]
}
```
</Frame>
If you would prefer it to be output as an object, indexed by a key add a column with the title `!id`. The value of this field will be used as the key. 

<Frame caption="Modified output using !id field">
```json
{
  "worksheet_name": {
	"first_value_from_!id_field": {
		"first_column_name": "a",
		"second_column_name": 1,
	},
	"second_value_from_!id_field": {
		"first_column_name": "b",
		"second_column_name": 2,
	}
  }
}
```
</Frame>

### Outputting a Worksheet as Key-Value Pairs

If a worksheet only contains two columns with the titles `!key` and `!value` they will be output in the following format.  

You may still use non-outputted columns such as a commented column or `!hide` in worksheets using this format. 

```json
{
  "worksheet_name": {
	"key_1": "value_1",
	"key_2": "value_2"
  }
}
```
