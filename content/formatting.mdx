## Basic Structure

```json
{
  "worksheet_name": [

  ],
  "another_worksheet": [

  ]
}
```

## Naming Conventions

Starsheet does not impose any naming convention for worksheets and fields. The JSON output will mirror the exact names used in the Google Sheet to ensure interoperability with all programming languages and frameworks. 

Whilst you are free to include spaces and a mix of capitalisation in your worksheet and field names, we strongly recommend adopting a consistent naming convention such as `snake_case`, `camelCase` or `PascalCase`. 

<Info>
In the future, we may introduce a project-level setting to automatically convert spreadsheets to your preferred naming convention. Please contact us if this feature is important to you and you wish to be an early adopter.
