title: 'Basic Structure'
---

Starsheet does not impose strict structure requirements for your spreadsheet. The only requirement is that Starsheet assumes your data has a single heading row which will be used for the JSON keys. 

## Basic Structure

By default, each worksheet from your spreadsheet will be output as an array of JSON objects, with each object representing a row in that spreadsheet. For example:

```json
{
  "worksheet_name": [
	  {
		  "your_column_name": "Foo"
	  },
	  {
		  "your_column_name": "Bar"
	  }
  ],
  "another_worksheet": [
	...
  ]
}
```

## Google Sheet Features

### <Icon icon="check" iconType="solid" /> Supported Features
The following Google Sheet features are known to work with Starsheet. Most will have no impact on the output data, but editor-facing features like Data Validation and Conditional Formatting can be used to create a robust editing experience that minimises bugs caused by data issues.

## Naming Conventions

Starsheet does not impose any naming convention for worksheets and fields. The JSON output will mirror the exact names used in the Google Sheet to ensure interoperability with all programming languages and frameworks. 

Whilst you are free to include spaces and a mix of capitalisation in your worksheet and field names, we strongly recommend adopting a consistent naming convention such as `snake_case`, `camelCase` or `PascalCase`. 

<Info>
In the future, we may introduce a project-level setting to automatically convert spreadsheets to your preferred naming convention. Please contact us if this feature is important to you and you wish to be an early adopter.

### Special/Reserved Characters

The following symbols are used by Starsheet to trigger specific behaviours so should not be used in field and/or worksheet names unless you are looking to trigger the functionality described.
