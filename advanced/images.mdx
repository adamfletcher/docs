<Warning>Image Uploads are only available on the Teams plan.</Warning>

Images contained within cells within your Google Sheet will have the following impact on the output: 

- An additional `$images` object at the root of the JSON document which contains a manifest of all images indexed by filename,  containing:
	- `url` (relative to the URL of the JSON document that was requested)
	- `size_bytes`
	- `mime_type`
- The field containing the image will be output as a JSON object with the keys:
	- `$type` which will always be set to `image`
	- `filename` which is a reference to the key in the root `$images` object

The filename is a hash of the image contents so if multiple copies of the same image are contained within the source image they will share the same hash/filename and will result in one entry in the `$images` object.
