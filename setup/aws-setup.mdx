Starsheet provides a Cloudformation template, which will automatically setup the necessary resources on your AWS account in just a few clicks. 

- 1x **S3 Bucket**, used to store the data that Starsheet generates for your project
- 1x **Cloudfront Distribution**, which acts as a CDN to deliver content to end users at lower latency than loading from S3 directly
- 1x **IAM Role**, used by Starsheet to access the above resources. 

## Cost

None of the resources provisioned by Starsheet incur a setup or ongoing hourly/monthly charge. 

Pricing for S3 and Cloudfront is based on the amount of data stored and transferred. Most Starsheet customers will incur very little (less than a few dollars a month) or no AWS costs at all due to free usage tiers provided by AWS. 

<Tip>Please note that free usage tiers is shared across your whole AWS account so other applications on your AWS account may already be consuming your free usage allowance. </Tip>

  **Free Usage**

# Permissions

Our Cloudformation template grants Starsheet with the minimal set of permissions required to function. Access is limited to only the resources that the Cloudformation template creates, and only the minimal set of permissions required is granted. More details on the specific permissions granted is available [here](AWS%20Permissions.md). 

You can verify this manually by viewing the [Cloudfront Template](https://starsheet-cloudformation-templates.s3.amazonaws.com/latest.json) file that Starsheet uses.
