Starsheet provides a Cloudformation template, which will automatically setup the necessary resources on your AWS account in just a few clicks. 

- 1x **S3 Bucket**, used to store the data that Starsheet generates for your project
- 1x **Cloudfront Distribution**, which acts as a CDN to deliver content to end users at lower latency than loading from S3 directly
- 1x **IAM Role**, used by Starsheet to access the above resources. 

## Cost

None of the resources provisioned by Starsheet incur a setup or ongoing hourly/monthly charge. 

Pricing for S3 and Cloudfront is based on the amount of data stored and transferred. Most Starsheet customers will incur very little (less than a few dollars a month) or no AWS costs at all due to free usage tiers provided by AWS. 

<Tip>Please note that free usage tiers is shared across your whole AWS account so other applications on your AWS account may already be consuming your free usage allowance. </Tip>
