Starsheet publishes content to resources on your AWS account. At a minimum Starsheet requires access to a **S3 Bucket**, but we also recommend using **Cloudfront** to distribute content to end uses. 

Startsheet can setup everything on your AWS account automatically in just a few clicks. We recommend this approach to ensure that everything is configured correctly, but if you prefer we also provide instructions on how to set things up manually yourself.

## Cost

None of the resources used by Starsheet incur a setup or ongoing hourly/monthly charge. 

Pricing for S3 and Cloudfront is based on the amount of data stored and transferred. Most Starsheet customers will incur very little (less than a few dollars a month) or no AWS costs at all due to free usage tiers provided by AWS. 

<Tip>Please note that free usage tiers is shared across your whole AWS account so other applications on your AWS account may already be consuming your free usage allowance. </Tip>

  **Free Usage**

  - Cloudfront: 1TB data transfer and 10 million requests per month is free of charge
  - S3: 5GB of free storage for 12 months from account creation 

  **Additional Usage Fees**

  - Cloudfront: \$0.085-\$0.120 per GB transfered, plus \$0.0075-$0.0160 per 10,000 requests (price varies per region)
  - S3: Less than $0.03 per GB stored per month. 
  
  Typical Startsheet usage will result in less than 1GB being stored on S3. Data transfer varies depending on the popularity of the application and size of data and images.
